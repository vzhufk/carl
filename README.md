### :pencil: Purpose:
While having fun with some open source libs, I discovered `node-nlp`. And tried it out.
### :ambulance: How to run:
Man, just:
```
npm run start
```
### :construction_worker: How to customize:
Ugh. TO make some changes in responses nd training process just opne folder: `lib/manager/train/`.
And dowhatever you want to. Just dont mess it up.
